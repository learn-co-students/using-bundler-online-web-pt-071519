# gem 'mail', '~> 2.6', '>= 2.6.3'
# Rubyists have decided to call this ~> "Twiddle-Wakka." '~> 2.6' 
# means any minor version above 2.6. 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 would work (including patches); but version 3.0 wouldn't work because it indicates a new major version.

# The mail gem has a second specification '>= 2.6.3'. 
# This means any version greater than or equal to 2.6.3. Because the mail gem has two specifications, both have to be true, so this gem couldn't use version 2.6 because it's lower than 2.6.3
